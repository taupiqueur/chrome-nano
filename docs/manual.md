## Usage

`Ctrl+I` is the main keyboard shortcut.

Use it to edit text areas in webpages with nano.

### Configure keyboard shortcuts

Navigate to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` to configure keyboard shortcuts.

### Configure the text editor program

You can also configure the text editor program by importing and exporting settings
in the **Options** pageâ€”Right-click the nano toolbar button and select **Options**.

Example configuration:

``` json
{
  "nano": {
    "command": "xterm",
    "args": ["-e", "nano"]
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  "nano": {
    "command": "open",
    "args": ["-n", "-W"]
  }
}
```

Make sure the commands are in your `PATH`.

On macOS, you can set the `PATH` environment variable for all services through [launchctl].

``` sh
sudo launchctl config user path "$PATH"
```
